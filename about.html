                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Growing up in Seattle I have been surrounded by the technology industry. I begun to realize how innovative and cool this industry is and choose to take a further look. In high school taking a few coding classes I became hooked to that technical side of work. As I was deciding on what major to pick I wanted to combine my technical passion with my social skills. From there I learned a lot as an Managment Information Systems (MIS) major as San Diego State Univerity.</p>
