            <p>I started this for an MIS class and decided to roll with it. Have fun looking around!</p>
            <p>My goal is to inform you more about me in general wether you are looking for fun or professionally. I have been coding since 16 years old and have always found it interesting. As I decided on what to do with college I wanted to combine my technical passions with my social skills. This website is a great example of the combination because I have coded this from skratch and now I can show you more about my professional and personal experinces.</p>
